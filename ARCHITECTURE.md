# System Architecture

## Camera Preview Implementation

### Mirrored Preview Behavior
The camera preview implementation follows modern mobile camera UX patterns by applying mirroring selectively:

1. Preview Display
   - Front camera preview is mirrored horizontally
   - This matches users' expectations from selfie cameras
   - Creates natural "mirror-like" interaction during composition

2. Capture Processing
   - Captured images are NOT mirrored
   - Preserves real-world orientation of scene
   - Ensures text and asymmetric objects appear correctly

### Technical Implementation
The mirroring effect is achieved through CSS transforms on the preview element, while keeping the underlying video capture stream unmodified. This separation ensures:

1. Clean separation of concerns between display and capture logic
2. Optimal performance by avoiding unnecessary image processing
3. Straightforward testing and maintenance
4. Flexibility for future enhancements

### Key Components
- Preview Container: Manages the camera feed display and applies mirror transform
- Capture Handler: Processes raw camera data without mirroring
- Orientation Manager: Coordinates preview and capture orientations

### Design Decisions
1. Mirror Transform Application
   - Applied via CSS for performance
   - Only affects visual preview
   - No impact on captured image quality

2. Preview/Capture Separation
   - Maintains clear boundaries between display and data layers
   - Simplifies debugging and testing
   - Follows single responsibility principle

This architecture ensures a professional, maintainable implementation that delivers a polished user experience matching industry standards.

## TypeScript Implementation

### Overview
The codebase employs TypeScript to enhance type safety and code reliability. Following a strict type-checking policy, the TypeScript setup ensures robust component interactions and predictable data flows.

### Component Structure
- Components utilize the .tsx extension, aligning seamlessly with React's functional component paradigm.
- Reusable prop interfaces promote component consistency and reduce duplication.
- Function components implement React.FC typing, reinforcing type certainty.

### Key Components
- **CameraComponent**: Provides a professional-grade interface for camera operations, integrating overlays and photo capture.
- **ErrorBoundary**: Enhances resilience by intercepting and handling runtime errors, ensuring stability.
- **OverlayGuide** and **PhotoFrame**: Offer visual guidance and frame overlay capabilities, assisting users in taking optimal photos.

### Type Definitions
- Centralized in the /types directory, type definitions establish common interfaces and shared structures, supporting strong type enforcement.

### Error Handling Patterns
Error handling is centralized in dedicated components like **ErrorBoundary** to isolate and manage asynchronous errors. The approach standardizes error flows and provides consistent user feedback. This includes logging mechanisms and user notifications while preserving interface integrity.
