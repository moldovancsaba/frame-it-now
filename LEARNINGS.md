# Camera Preview and Capture Implementation Learnings

## Frontend

### Camera Preview Mirroring Implementation
- Added CSS-based mirroring for the camera preview using `transform: scaleX(-1)`
- Preview is mirrored to match user expectations (like a mirror)
- Captured photos maintain correct orientation
- Implementation follows standard mobile camera app behavior

### Test Results

#### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (Desktop)
  - Preview appears correctly mirrored
  - Captured images stored in correct orientation
  - UI elements maintain normal orientation
  - Performance: No noticeable impact

- ✅ Firefox (Desktop)
  - Preview correctly mirrored
  - Image capture orientation preserved
  - UI elements normal
  - Performance: Smooth operation

- ✅ Safari (Desktop)
  - Preview mirroring works as expected
  - Capture orientation correct
  - UI unaffected
  - Performance: Efficient

#### Mobile Testing
- ✅ Chrome (Mobile)
  - Preview mirroring works in both portrait and landscape
  - Captures oriented correctly
  - UI stable
  - Performance: Good

- ✅ Safari (Mobile)
  - Preview mirroring consistent
  - Capture orientation proper
  - UI maintains position
  - Performance: Responsive

#### Device Orientation
- ✅ Portrait mode: Preview and capture working correctly
- ✅ Landscape mode: Orientation handled properly
- ✅ Device rotation: UI adjusts smoothly

#### Lighting Conditions
- ✅ Bright lighting: Clear preview, accurate capture
- ✅ Low light: Preview maintains visibility
- ✅ Mixed lighting: Consistent performance

### Implementation Details
1. CSS-based preview mirroring
   ```css
   .mirror-preview {
     transform: scaleX(-1);
     -webkit-transform: scaleX(-1);
     -moz-transform: scaleX(-1);
     filter: FlipH;
     -ms-filter: "FlipH";
   }
   ```

2. Canvas-based capture process
   - Maintains original orientation during capture
   - Prevents double-mirroring issues
   - Ensures text and objects appear correct in final image

### Performance Impact
- Minimal CPU usage for CSS transforms
- No additional memory overhead
- Smooth preview and capture operations
- No frame rate impact observed

### Best Practices Identified
1. Use CSS transforms for preview mirroring
2. Keep capture process orientation-aware
3. Maintain original orientation in stored images
4. Separate preview and capture orientations
5. Consider cross-browser compatibility

### Future Considerations
1. Monitor performance on lower-end devices
2. Consider adding orientation preferences
3. Implement fallback for unsupported browsers
4. Add automated tests for orientation handling
