# JavaScript to TypeScript Migration Planning Document

## 1. Version Update Protocol

### Version Increment Tasks
- [ ] Update version to 0.2.0 in package.json
- [ ] Document version change in RELEASE_NOTES.md using format: ## [v0.2.0] â€” YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Review and update all relevant documentation files:
  - [ ] README.md
  - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md
  - [ ] TASKLIST.md
  - [ ] LEARNINGS.md
  - [ ] ROADMAP.md

### Rationale for Version 0.2.0
The increment to 0.2.0 represents a significant enhancement in the project's architecture through TypeScript migration, warranting a MINOR version increment as per semantic versioning protocols.

## 2. Codebase Analysis Plan

### JavaScript to TypeScript Conversion Mapping
- [ ] Identify all JavaScript files requiring conversion
- [ ] Create inventory of files with:
  - File path
  - Current functionality
  - Conversion complexity assessment
  - Dependencies that need updating

### Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Document current dependency versions
- [ ] Identify version mismatches between packages
- [ ] List required TypeScript-specific dependencies
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix for existing dependencies with TypeScript

### Code Quality Assessment
- [ ] Map areas of code duplication
- [ ] Document architectural inconsistencies
- [ ] Identify potential structural improvements
- [ ] List technical debt items to be addressed during migration

## Implementation Priority
1. Version update implementation
2. Dependency audit and resolution
3. Codebase analysis and documentation
4. Creation of detailed migration strategy

## Success Criteria
- Complete version update across all documentation
- Comprehensive mapping of JavaScript files for conversion
- Clear documentation of all dependency requirements
- Detailed analysis of code quality issues to address
